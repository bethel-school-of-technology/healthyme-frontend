        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            HealthyMeWe was created by Jordan Page, Jason Walker, Chris Jeffers, and Ian Ditsch, otherwise known as the
            Fantastic4Developers. It was created in October 2019 and continues to be built out to increase it’s features
            and presentation. HealthyMeWe is just that, the individual and the group, working together to create health.
            The fundamental principle it runs on is that your own personal health is inseparably connected to community
            health.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here the Fantastic4Developers invent and innovate to advance society in ways that make a rippling effect and
            impact that lasts and continues to grow. It takes all of you to make all of us, the many from the one,
            synergized and collectively walking out life and health as one unit.

        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>
            We believe in mutual respect and honor of all people at all times, having an atmosphere of positivity and
            encouragement recognizing the power of words, and raising the bar over time by increasing, growing, and
            moving forward.
            <br>
            <br>
            These three tenets are the foundation of HealthyMeWe: Respect, Positivity, and Growth
