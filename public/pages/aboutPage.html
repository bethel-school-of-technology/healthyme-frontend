        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
        HealthyMeWe was created by Jordan Page, Jason Walker, Chris Jeffers, and Ian Ditsch, otherwise known as the Fantastic4Developers. It was created in October 2019 and continues to be built out to increase it’s features and presentation. HealthyMeWe is just that, the individual and the group, working together to create health. The fundamental principle it runs on is that your own personal health is inseparably connected to community health. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Here the Fantastic4Developers invent and innovate to advance society in ways that make a rippling effect and impact that lasts and continues to grow. It takes all of you to make all of us, the many from the one, synergized and collectively walking out life and health as one unit.
